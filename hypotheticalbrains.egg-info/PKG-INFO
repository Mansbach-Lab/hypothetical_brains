hypothetical brains is a packaged designed to transform neuroimaging data into graphical networks of voxels. It uses a clustering algorithm (cKDTree) to create subgraphs based on the similarity between pairs of voxels across several features. These clusters become subgraphs which are used to train a graphical neural network. The GNN is then used to augment the dataset. Finally, the augmented dataset may be analysed using topological techniques to identify commonalities among individual brains.
